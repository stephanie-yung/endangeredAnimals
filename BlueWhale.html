                            <p>Extinction Risk: <strong>Endangered</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                The blue whale is famously known as the largest animal on Earth and can grow up to 100 ft in length and weigh over 200 tons. They are filter-feeders, using baleen plates in mouth made of keratin to strain krill from the ocean water. The largest ones may eat up to 6 tons of krill in one day.  
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Blue whales were abundant before the 20th century, with an estimated population of over 250,000. However, with the advent of modern commercial whaling as hunters sold their blubber to suppliers to make oil, food, clothing, and other products, their population was drastically reduced. Today, it is estimated that there are only 10,000 to 25,000 left.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Going forward, one of the major threats towards blue whales is climate change, as their habitat is predicted is decrease significantly due to ocean warming and acidification. Krill populations are particularly sensitive to these changes in temperature and pH. The other major threat is continued commercial whaling. Although outlawed in 1986 by the IWC (International Whaling Commission), several countries including Norway, Iceland, and Japan still actively engage in whaling, with over a thousand killed each year for commercial gain. Other minor anthropogenic threats include ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, ocean noise, pollutants, plastics, and oil.

                                Numerous conservation groups keep a close eye on blue whales. Since 1955 ICRW has given them complete protection and they are classified as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and considered depleted and strategic under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
